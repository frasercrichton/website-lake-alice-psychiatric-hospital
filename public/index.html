  <title>Lake Alice Psychiatric Hospital: a visual investigation into the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit.</title>

  <meta name="description"
    content="Lake Alice Psychiatric Hospital was the notorious site of the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit in Aotearoa New Zealand. The Unit operated from the 1970s until around 1980 when it was closed as a result of complaints about the use of aversion therapy including Electroconvulsive therapy used as a punishment against the children held in the unit. The Psychiatrist in charge of the unit, Dr Selwyn Leeks, was never held accountable and survivors of Lake Alice still wait for adequate redress." />

  <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
