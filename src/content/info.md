Lake Alice Psychiatric Hospital was an isolated, self-contained psychiatric facility that opened in 1950 on Te Ika-a-Māui the North Island of Aotearoa New Zealand 6km outside of Marton.   

The hospital was organised around a system of villas. The small eleven-bed villas were seen as advanced at the time providing intensive dedicated group therapy for patients. Some of these patients included returned servicemen suffering PTSD. Some of these servicemen died and were buried at Lake Alice in unmarked graves. The villas also included a Maximum Security Unit for the criminally insane.

In the modern context, this sounds like an unlikely place to site a unit for the care of children and adolescents. However, in 1972 Te Wāhanga Tamaiti, Taitamariki o Lake the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit (LACAU) opened. This unit was notorious in its day. It served as a hub for a failed system of child State care. Rather than treating tamariki for genuine psychiatric conditions, it was used principally as a punishment for children held in a national network of state care facilities. This network expanded during the 1950s as criminal justice and social service legislation prejudicially entrapped indigenous Māori whānau after an urban drift following the Second World War. This legislation also ensnared many Pasifika and Pākehā in the care system.

State Care in Aotearoa saw high levels of abuse. Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit became a dumping ground for children that rebelled against the brutal system they found themselves in.

The Child and Adolescent Unit opened in 1972 with Dr Selwyn Leeks appointed Director for the first 12-bed unit. By June 1977 the Children and Adolescent Unit had expanded to house 46 children – 36 boys and 10 girls at one point in time - aged between 8 and 16 years. Survivors report children as young as 4.

Selwyn Leeks and other staff members were free to run a system which brutalised children through seclusion in solitary confinement, as well as psychological and physical assault. Psychiatric treatments that were considered acceptable at the time were weaponised against children. For even minor behavioural infractions children received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or painful Paraldehyde injections. Unmodified ECT - administered to sensitive parts of the body without anaesthetic - was continually used as a punishment for bad behaviour. Sexual assault and rape also occurred in the LACAU.

This regime was finally challenged in 1975 by the actions of Hakeaga (Hake) Halo one of the children in LACAU who was 13 at the time. Hake wrote an English-language letter to his family. To deceive hospital censors he drew a smiley face at the end with a Niuean speech bubble that said: "I have been given electric shock by the people, mum. The pain is very bad." His story Auckland Committee on Racism and Discrimination (ACORD)

The investigation that followed resulted in the closure of the Child and Adolescent Unit in 1978. Leeks and other members of staff escaped police charges, however. For the next 40 years, survivors of Lake Alice had to battle for compensation and an independent inquiry. This includes Malcolm Richards who has contributed to this website and whose testimony can be heard here.

Only in 2021 have charges finally been laid against one member of Lake Alice staff after pressure from the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care. Dr Leeks was medically unfit to stand trial and died in 2022.

Lake Alice Psychiatric Hospital closed in October 1999 and was demolished in 2016.
