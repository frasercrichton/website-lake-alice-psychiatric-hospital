Kia ora Sasha,

Not sure if you are still at Archives but we spoke a while back about a project I'm working on with one of the survivors of Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit. I'm currently working on a new version of our website and I was wondering if it would be possible to order some high resolution scans of some images? The website is non-commercial so should fit with the terms of use. If you could give me a rough idea of how much it would be for teh scans that would be great.

The images are as follows:

Title: Mental Hospitals. Publicity Caption: Administration block, Lake Alice Psychiatric Hospital, Marton. Photographer: Mr Cleal.

Archway Series Number:6539

Not sure how you scan but for the web I'd need something like:

72 ppi
minimum 1500px on the long edge

Unfortunately I'm currently based in UK as I had to come back last year to sort out my mum's house when she died last year so this could make things a bit tricky but hopefully not.

If by chance you come across any other images of Lake Alice (there were a couple used in the final Royal Commission report of the villas that didn't have references)

Ngā mihi nui,

Fraser
