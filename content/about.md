## About

This website was developed as part of an ongoing project - The Moral Drift - examining the history of State care in Aotearoa New Zealand. In its first phase, it was exhibited at Toi Tauranga Tauranga Art Gallery in October 2021 - [The Moral Drift](https://www.artgallery.org.nz/exhibitions/id/1751).

This interdisciplinary project has been developed by a collective of investigative researchers.  It brings together Fraser Crichton — a Te Whanganui-a-Tara based researcher and documentary photographer, Malcolm Richards — a survivor of abuse in care at the former Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit, and Lachlan Kermode — a Research Fellow at the international human rights agency Forensic Architecture. 

In this online phase, they attempt to visualise Te Wāhanga Tamaiti, Taitamariki o Lake Alice The Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit site. The State demolished Lake Alice between 2016 and 2018.
